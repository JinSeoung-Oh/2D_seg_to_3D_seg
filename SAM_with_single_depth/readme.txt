I cannot upload my full code bacause of my personal probelm.
This repository just save my idea and result

First, run Grounded-Segment-Anything-main/grounded_sam_demo_get_coordination.py
Second, run extract_depth_with_zoedepth_model.py
        I think final result is not good, becuase of depth map
        So, if you know good depth estimation model then just use your model
        
Next, run matching_2d_colod_label_and_3D_point.py

The final result is saved in final_result.JPG
